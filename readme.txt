== A Gentle reminder on GDPR's Right to be forgotten ==

The right to be forgotten dovetails with people’s right to access their personal information in [Article 15](https://gdpr.eu/article-15-right-of-access/). The right to control one’s data is meaningless if people cannot take action when they no longer consent to processing, when there are significant errors within the data, or if they believe information is being stored unnecessarily. In these cases, an individual can request that the data be erased. 

You have one month to respond to a request. I understand you're busy. Make it easy by allowing users to erase their personal data.

**I am not a lawyer and this is not a legal advice.** In all circumstances I strongly recommend you consult directly with legal counsel familiar with the GDPR regulations.
